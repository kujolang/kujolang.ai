# Recommendations and measurement plan

Audit date: 2026-10-03

## Immediate after deployment

- Verify the new route, trailing-slash redirect behavior, canonical, sitemap entry, structured data, social metadata, hero and responsive variants, and cross-site documentation links at the production edge.
- Request indexing through the site's existing Search Console/Bing workflow if maintainers use one; do not treat submission as an indexing guarantee.

## 7-day checks

- Check Google and Bing coverage for the exact route and inspect server or CDN logs for legitimate crawler access and errors.
- Confirm referral tagging and page analytics without inferring search performance from direct traffic.

## 28-, 60-, and 90-day comparisons

- Compare impressions, clicks, CTR, average position, indexed state, referring queries, backlinks, ChatGPT/Bing referrals, and controlled AI-answer mentions against this dated baseline.
- Repeat the same locale, device, provider, and question set for any rank or AI-answer observation.

## Editorial decisions

- Refresh the page when Presentations leaves preview, changes platform support, publishes a new release, changes its npm distribution status, or completes human accessibility/language review.
- Keep claims aligned with the Presentations repository and tag-specific documentation.
